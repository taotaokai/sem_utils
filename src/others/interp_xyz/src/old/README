DESCRIPTION

  this code is used to interpolated one mesh data to the give (x,y,z) locations.

ALGORITHM

for each mesh slice
 
  read in gll/element information

  for each (x,y,z)

    if (x,y,z) is marked finished, exit
   
    check if (x,y,z) inside this slice, if not, exit

    get the element which (x,y,z) locates inside

    interpolate model values at (x,y,z)

    mark this point as finished
   
  endfor
    
  check the largest residual distance
  
  write out the model files for then new slice mesh

endfor

NOTICE

  2) before compilation: 

    - replace constants.h with the files you use. 
    - And also modify the user_par.f90 carefully. Make sure the mesh dimension parameters are set correctly and also the MARGIN parameters. Also the directories of old/new mesh data and output.
